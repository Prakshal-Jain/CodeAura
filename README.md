# What is CodeAura?
As an artist, you would have definitely experienced the moments when you go out to a workspace with like minded people and accomplish the tasks you like! Chilling out with your teammates or discussing an amazing idea! With the advent of a pandemic, this experience have come to a halt.

Well, no.

Our mission is to make the workspace experience more realistic and closer to natural ways of communcation, and bringing people from diverse backgrounds together to work on breakthrough ideas!
