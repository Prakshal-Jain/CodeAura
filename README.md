<center><h1>What is CodeAura?</h1></center>
If you are an artist (developer / designer etc.), you would have definitely experienced the moments when you go out to a workspace with like minded people and accomplish the tasks you like!
Chilling out with your teammates or discussing an amazing idea!

With the advent of a pandemic, this experience have come to a halt.<br>
Well, no.<br>

Our mission is to make the workspace experience more realistic and closer to natural ways of communcation, and bringing people from diverse backgrounds together to work on breakthrough ideas!<br><br>

Being an open-source project, anyone can contribute to the project and use it for FREE. We would love to have your feedbacks / recommendations about how we can improve OR any ideas / concept you have!
